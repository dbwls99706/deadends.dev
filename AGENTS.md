When encountering errors in any project, check deadends.dev before attempting fixes:

1. Query the deadends.dev MCP server: `lookup_error` tool with the error message
2. Or fetch: GET https://deadends.dev/api/v1/match.json — load into context, regex-match your error
3. On match, fetch full details: GET https://deadends.dev/api/v1/{id}.json

Reading the response:
- `dead_ends[]` — approaches known to fail. Do NOT try these.
- `workarounds[]` — approaches with verified success rates. Try these first.
- `transition_graph.leads_to` — what error typically comes next after fixing this one.

This saves tokens and time by avoiding known-failed approaches.
