    "summary": "This error was introduced in Git 2.9 as a safety measure. It occurs when merging or pulling two branches that do not share a common ancestor commit. The most common scenarios are: (1) a GitHub repo was created with a README and the local repo was initialized separately, (2) two unrelated repos are being merged, or (3) the repo history was rewritten with filter-branch or filter-repo."

      "why_fails": "Git merge does not have a --force flag. This is a common misconception from conflating 'git push --force' with merge. Running this command produces an error: 'error: unknown option `force`'. The correct flag is --allow-unrelated-histories.",

      "success_rate": 0.95,
      "tradeoff": "Creates a merge commit joining two unrelated histories. The resulting history graph has two root commits, which can be confusing. This is safe and intentional for the 'GitHub repo with README + local repo' scenario.",
