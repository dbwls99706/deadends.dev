    "summary": "This fatal error occurs when PHP cannot locate a class that exists in the codebase because Composer's autoload map is stale. It is the single most frequent error AI coding agents produce when scaffolding new classes, models, or services: the agent creates the file with the correct namespace but does not regenerate the autoloader. Other causes include PSR-4 namespace-to-directory mismatches and case sensitivity issues on Linux filesystems."

      "why_fails": "Manual requires bypass the PSR-4 autoloading standard that frameworks like Laravel and Symfony depend on. Other parts of the codebase that expect the class to be autoloadable will still fail. This creates fragile path dependencies and breaks when the file is moved or the project structure changes. It also prevents the class from being discovered by service containers and dependency injection.",
