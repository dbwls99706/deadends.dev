    "summary": "A React component suspended (threw a Promise) but there is no Suspense boundary ancestor to catch it and show a fallback UI, or a synchronous update caused a suspension that would replace visible content with a fallback. In React 18, components using React.lazy(), data fetching libraries with Suspense support, or the 'use' hook must be wrapped in a <Suspense> boundary. Without it, the thrown Promise propagates as an unhandled error."

      "why_fails": "A single top-level Suspense boundary replaces the entire application UI with a loading indicator whenever any component suspends.
