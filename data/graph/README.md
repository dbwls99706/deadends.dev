# Error Transition Graph

This directory will contain transition graph data in JSONL format.
See `deadend-dev-master-spec.md` Section 6 for specification.

Graph edges are collected from:
1. Evidence-based analysis during canon generation
2. AI agent visit pattern analysis (post-launch)

Not yet populated — graph data accumulates as canons are created.
